1. authenticating developers (register and login)
2. display a main page to showcase all apps on 
3. building a dynamically generated page to show info about the click on app
4. building a dynamically generated page to show each developer's app inventory along with his/her name
5. allowing downloads to happen only if a mobile android OS is accessing it
6. generating a url that is specfic to each developer's profile
7. geneating a url that can be used to directly find that app
